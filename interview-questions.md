# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Jake

Your answer: Git is a type of storage, and Github is a cloud based repository service that stores your git projects, and allows you to collaborate with other developers.

Researched answer:(resource:https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/what-is-git)
Git is a version control system that allows multiple developers to add code to the same project through seperate branches. This is extremely helpful because there are multiple levels of safety to protect your main code source. It has the ability to track the project and let all the developers to see who has made changes. It also allows all of the developers working on the project to have their own copy on their local computer. This allows more communication between the developing team, and a clear log of who, what, where, and when the document was altered or accessed.

GitHub is a company that will store your git projects and all types of open sourced code in a cloud-based repository. It gives you and your team access to git for ease of collaboration, and version control to track all edits, deletions, and merges to your project in a central hub. Github allows you to push your teams edited code from your local system to a specific repository, and make sure there are no coding conflicts before you merge all of your branches.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Elmer

   Operators that return Bolean values are:
        ==, ===, !=, >, <, &&, ||, ! and combinations of them.

Researched answer:

    The comparison operators, such as "equal to" (==), "not equal to" (!=), "less than" (<), "greater than" (>), and their variations, will return a Boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. Additionally, logical operators, such as "and" (&&), "or" (||), and "not" (!), also return Boolean values based on the evaluation of the operands. (Assisted by Codeacademy)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Jose

Your answer: The best way I can describe an index is by imagining a cubby hole set that only has one row. This one row cuby hole has collapsable inner walls that be re arranged to custom fit each cubby. however, this is a magical cubby hole because we can add or take out as many indiviual cubies as we want to. But is this case, keeping the cubby hole to 5 cubbies is good for now. And we decided to label each cubie, and wanted to be labeled by numbers. we start at the first one on the left and we will label it "0", the next cubie "1", and so on until we reach the 5 cubie labeled "4". 

Using the cubby holes anology, I consider the index of an array as being the same as each cubby hole. arrayOne.index "1" = Second slot to left of an actual cubby hole.

As for value of an array, it is the product/element that is inserted, altered, or removed in each cuby hole.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Sam

Your answer: Arrays and strings are similar in that they hold an ordered series of values. In strings, these values are always a single character. In arrays these values can be many data types, including strings themselves, so they are more commonly used for storage of other values while a string is often itself the data you want stored.

Researched answer: The main diiference between Arrays and Strings are that one, the string, is a data type that is comprised of characters, and an array is a data structure used to hold a collection of data. An array can hold many elements of the same type, though they are not limited to a single form of data like strings. They are similar in that they can both be manipulated in similar ways, and strings can even be easily represented by an array of characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Nguyen

Your answer: Pair programing involves contributions of two developers.  While one is manipulating the code and making changes based of calls the navigator is making. They control and maintain the active workspace. This developer is in the role as Driver.  The Navigator's contribution is the over-viewer.  They contribute through adding input of ideads, brainstorm, syntax and grammer corrections.  The navigator is not actively engaged with the keyboard, because of this reserve role they are afforded more room to focus on the big picture.  It is important for both developers to perform in both of these roles to understand the perspective of hands on, actively engaged, and reserve overview.  Big picture, Little picture.  This wholistic approach better insures complete best practice execution is 
attained when developing.

Researched answer: While this approach may lengthen the input of hours to compete a job, the method insures are more robust, clean, and precise product.  This also mitigates potential bugs, and errors made because there are less instances of merging code.
